<div style="text-align: justify">This tool allows users to upload any image and instantly generate a high-definition version with customizable rounded corners and background modes (transparent or black). The preview perfectly matches the final downloadable result, thanks to 2x supersampling for ultra-smooth edges. Ideal for avatars, poster designs, UI elements, and more. </div>

In addition, another more powerful tool is provided here. The <a href="https://sean28.github.io/multi-round-image/">Rounded Multi-Image Board</a> is a web-based tool for creating custom image layouts. It allows users to upload, resize, rotate, and arrange multiple images on a canvas with adjustable backgrounds and styles. The final composition can be exported as a PNG.
